                Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might
                be
                decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being?
                That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything
                committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.

                Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in
                Hindi,
                which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is
                their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles
                (I'm looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the
                entire
                first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first
                time
                child actor – played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar – and it's one of the best first acts I've seen in
                years.
                Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the
                filmmakers do
                a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen. </p>

                even seen the trailer
                but
                I was so incredibly moved by Saroo's story that I decided to watch it again 10 days later. It's the kind
                of
                film that stays with you hours or even days after you leave the cinema. It's not just an amazing true
                story
                but the acting is superb, the musical score haunting and the cinematography stunning. My decision to see
                it
                for a second time was partly due to how much I'd enjoyed the film but also in case I'd missed something
                of
                importance through all the tears. Well that didn't work out well as I cried even more the second time
                round
                as I knew the significance of certain scenes.

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-down">It has been mentioned on this page that one of the writers is "Saroo Brierly
                    (novel)". His book is
                    not a novel. It is a biography. I am from Khandwa where the boy in the story (Saroo Brierly) hails.
                    My residence is just about two kilometres from his mother's residence. A few years ago I met him
                    'accidentally' and spoke to him briefly. I was totally excited to meet him. He does not know his
                    mother tongue Hindi. He talks with an Australian accent. His book 'A Long Way Home' is worth
                    reading. In the movie his adult role is played by a 'white' man. It should have been a 'brown' man
                    to reflect real appearance. The child actor who plays the role of child Saroo is in fact a child who
                    was washing teacups for a living in a roadside snack shop on the Khandwa-Indore road. His acting and
                    voice are true to what would have been that of a local boy. Saroo's life has touched the hearts of
                    many. In fact his story was topic of a sermon in our little Church in Hyderabad</p>

                    you
                    are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a
                    past
                    that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper.
                    This is
                    a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach
                    somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that "there
                    are
                    no white pages" but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish

                    man. Lion is not a great

                    screaming at the main character, go to India and see your family already! This would have been a
                    good documentary. Spare us the Aussie attempt at angst, it just doesn't work. Here we have a lucky
                    young man with a loving family, all grown up in the "lucky country". What's the problem? He can
                    figure out where to go in India to see his birth village, but we have to endure an hour of film with
                    him being moody around his supportive girlfriend and family. Talk about manufactured drama. The
                    scene with Nicole Kidman and Patel seemed pointless - just a contractual opportunity for her to show
                    off her acting chops and make this sellable overseas. Don't be fooled. This is a great story, but

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-down">
                    Am I the only one who wanted to punch Dev Patel in the face while watching this film? He plays Saroo
                    Brierley, a young Indian man who was separated from his family when he was a little boy, funneled
                    into the Indian orphan system, and adopted by a loving Australian couple. He longs to return to
                    India to see his birth family again, but is torn between wanting to reconnect with his roots and
                    remaining loyal to the people who raised him.

                    The first half of "Lion" is the film at its best, thanks to the winningly adorable Sunny Pawar, who
                    plays Saroo as a little boy. But once Saroo ages into Patel, the film turns into a saggy,
                    interminable series of scenes in which Patel mopes, lashes out at everyone who's nice to him, and
                    spends every night staring at Google Earth while taking no action whatsoever. What his actual
                    dilemma is is never made clear by the screenplay or Patel's performance. I stated above that he's
                    torn between two cultures, but I'm only conjecturing about that, since that's not shown in the
                    movie. Instead we watch a privileged man surrounded by supportive people whining about how he wants
                    to return to India while we watch him and want to scream at him, "Then get off your ass and just
                    visit India already!!"

                    Patel was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, but he didn't deserve to be. Nicole
                    Kidman, who plays his adoptive mother, was much more deserving of her Best Supporting Actress
                    nomination. The film also nabbed nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best
                    Cinematography, and Best Original Score, but won nothing.

                <p data-aos="zoom-in"> This is a beautiful film. The first half of the movie shines with its masterful
                    absence of dialogue
                    and the bustling Indian urban landscape. Sunny Pawar carries the soul of the film with his wide,
                    vibrant eyes radiating dignity and screen presence purely through facial expressions. He is a
                    natural. The second half of the film set in Tasmania thrives mostly in its contrast to India. Here,
                    Dev Patel does very well as a confused young man in search of his roots and his home. Nicole Kidman
                    steals the show with the few scenes in which she embodies motherly love and devotion. This is a must
                    watch. It is not possible for any person to watch this film and not be moved by it!</p>
